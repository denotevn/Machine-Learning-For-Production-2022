# Auto ML
   + AutoML automates the development of ML models
   + AutoML is not speciﬁc to a particular type of model.
   + Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a subﬁeld of AutoML
   + NAS is a technique for automating the design of artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN).

## Evolutionary algorithm in machine Learning
  + Feature selection: Evolutionary algorithms can be used to identify the most important features in a dataset, which can then be used in building a machine learning model.

  + Hyperparameter tuning: Evolutionary algorithms can be used to optimize the hyperparameters of a machine learning model, such as the learning rate, the number of hidden layers, etc.

  + Neural architecture search: Evolutionary algorithms can be used to search for the best neural network architecture for a given task, such as image classification or speech recognition.

  + Clustering: Evolutionary algorithms can be used to find the optimal number of clusters and cluster assignments in an unsupervised learning setting.

  + Genetic programming: Evolutionary algorithms can be used to evolve computer programs for a given task, such as playing a game or generating art.
## Reinforcement learning (RL) 
    + Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.
