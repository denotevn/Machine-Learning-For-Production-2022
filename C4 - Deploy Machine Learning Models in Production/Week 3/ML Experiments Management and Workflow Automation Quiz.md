1. Is debugging in ML different from debugging in software engineering?
  + Yes, debugging in ML is fundamentally different from debugging in software engineering.
  > Absolutely! ML debugging is often about a model not converging or not generalizing instead of some functional error like a segfault.
2. Which of the following tools allow you to track experiments with notebooks? (Select all that apply)
  + Jupytext
  > Jupytext converts and synchronizes pairs of notebooks with a matching Python file.
  + Nbdime
  > This tool enables diffing and merging of Jupyter Notebooks.
  + Nbconvert
  > Nbconvert can be used to extract just the Python from a notebook.
3. Which of the following are some good tools for Data Versioning?
  + Neptune
  > Neptune includes data versioning, experiment tracking, and a model registry.
  + Pachyderm
  > This tool lets you continuously update data in the master branch while experimenting with specific data in a separate branch.
  + Delta Lake
  > Delta Lake runs on top of your existing data lake and provides data versioning, including rollbacks and full historical audit trails.
4. True Or False: Concerns such as cost, performance, stability, scalability, maintainability, and schedule are much more important to data scientists than software engineers.
  + False
  > Software engineers identify themselves strongly with customer satisfaction and recognize infrastructure needs being as crucial as optimizing metrics. As a result, they strongly focus on quality, testing, and detecting and mitigating errors.
