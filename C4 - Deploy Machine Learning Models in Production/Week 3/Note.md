## Bridging ML and IT with MLOps
   + Continuous Integration (CI): Testing and validating code, components, data, data
schemas, and models
   + Continuous Delivery (CD): Not only about deploying a single software package or a
service, but a system which automatically deploys another service (model prediction
service)
   + Continuous Training (CT): A new process, unique to ML systems, that automatically
retrains candidate models for testing and serving
   + Continuous Monitoring (CM): Catching errors in production systems, and
monitoring production inference data and model performance metrics tied to
business outcomes
