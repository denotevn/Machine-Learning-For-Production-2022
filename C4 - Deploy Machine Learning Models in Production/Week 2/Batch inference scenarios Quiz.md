1. Which of the following are advantages of batch inference?
   + You can wait for data retrieval to make predictions since they are not made available in real time.
   + You donâ€™t need caching strategies so costs decrease.
   + You can use complex machine learning models to improve accuracy since there is no constraint on inference time.
2. True or False: The most important metric to optimize while performing batch predictions is throughput.
    + True
    > Yes! Triton Inference Server allows deployment of models from any framework, from local storage, Google Cloud Platform, or AWS S3.
3. How can you save inference costs when generating recommendations on e-commerce?
   + Generating them on a schedule.
