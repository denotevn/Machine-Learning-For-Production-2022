1. Question 1:Which of these are stages of the machine learning project lifecycle?
+ Deployment
+ Scoping
+ Data
+ Modeling
2. Which of these is not an advantage of a typical edge deployment compared to a typical cloud deployment?
+ More computational power available
> Correct
Edge deployments are frequently constrained in computational power due to cost, size, and energy requirements of the hardware. 
3. In the speech recognition example, what is the problem with some labelers transcribing audio as “Um, today’s weather” and others transcribing “Umm..., today’s weather”?
+ Either transcription is okay, but the inconsistency is problematic.
> Correct
That's right! The labelling instructions should remove ambiguity such that every example is labelled consistently. 
4. Question 4 After a system is deployed, monitoring and maintaining the system will help us handle cases of concept drift or data drift.
+ True 
> That's right! The last step of the machine learning project lifecycle is monitoring and maintenance, which is necessary because your project's use cases and data may change over time!
5. Which statement is a more accurate description of the full cycle of a machine learning project?
+ It is an iterative process, where during a later stage we might go back to an earlier stage. (That’s why we call it a cycle--it’s a circular process.)
