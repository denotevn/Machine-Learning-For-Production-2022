1. In the project scoping process, which of these is the first step?
    + Identify business problems
2. You are considering building a speech recognition system, where the innovation is to use a very low cost microphone that has just been newly invented. Suppose that a human, given an audio clip recorded from this new microphone, often cannot tell what was said (because the microphone has too much noise). What can you conclude from this? 
    + There is a high chance it will not be technically feasible for a learning algorithm to achieve high accuracy on this task.
    > That's correct! If a human labeler is unable to transcribe the audio, it's unlikely that your algorithm will be able to learn to either. 
3. You are considering building a product recommendation system. You carried out diligence on feasibility (the ability to give relevant recommendations), but not diligence on value. Which of these is the biggest risk for what could go wrong? 
    + You build the system and it gives relevant recommendations, but the system does not meaningfully improve key business metrics such as sales conversions or revenue.
    > You're right! This is why it's important to evaluate the business value of a project early on in the scoping process - so that you're addressing real business problems.
4. Which of these statements is the most accurate?
    + There is often a gap between MLE metrics (such as accuracy) and business metrics (such as revenue), and it is useful to try to have the teams compromise and agree on a middle ground that both teams are happy with.
5. All answers are true
