### Overwiew
  + The important of data: Data is gardest path and the most important piece to get right... broken data is the most common cause of problems in production ML systems
  + Production ML = ML development + sofware development
  + Data -> Training -> Evaluation -> Data .....
  + Managing the entire life cycle of data: 
    + Labeling
    + Feature space coverage
    + Minimal dimensionality
    + Maximum predictive data
    + Fairness 
    + Rare conditions
  + Modern software development:
    + Scalability: khả năng mở rộng
    + Extensibility: khả năng mở rộng
    + Configuration: Cấu hình 
    + Consistency and reproducibility: Tính nhất quán và khả năng tái sản xuất
    + Safety & security
    + Modularity
    + Testability
    + Monitoring 
    + Best practices
  + Product Machine Learning system:
    + Scoping: Define the project
    + Data: Defining the features, label and organize data
    + Modeling: Select and train model, perform error analysis
    + Deployment: Deploy in production, Monitor and maintain system
    + And go back iteratively 
  + Challenges in production grade ML:
    + Build integrated ML system
    + Continously operate it in production
    + Handle continously changing data
    + Optimize compute resource costs
