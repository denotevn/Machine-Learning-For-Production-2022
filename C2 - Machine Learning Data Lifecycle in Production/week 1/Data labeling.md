1. Which factors substantially complicate production machine learning? (Check all that apply)
  + Labeling through Weak Supervision
  + Model Retraining driven by declining model performance.
2. Direct Labeling is one of the methods used in production ML to label data. About it we can say that: 
  + It needs to match prediction results with their corresponding original inference request.
  > Feature selection identifies features with predictive power.
  + It captures strong label signals
3. A cardiologist labeling MRI images is a typical example of Direct Labeling.
  + False
  > MRI labeling by a medical specialist is an example of **Human Labeling**
