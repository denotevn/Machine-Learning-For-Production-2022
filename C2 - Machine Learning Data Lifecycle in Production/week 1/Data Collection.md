1. In ML, data are first-class citizens?
  + Yes
  > Just right! Data are entities that support all operations generally available to other entities.
2. A data pipeline is a series of data processing steps such as:
  + Data collection
  > Way to go! Data collection is the first step in building ML systems.
  + Data ingestion
  > Right on track! Data ingestion is the process of absorbing data from different sources and transferring it to a target site where it can be deposited and analyzed.
  + Data Preparation
  > You’ve got it! Data Preparation consists of data formatting, engineering and feature extraction.
3. Is the Data pipeline vital for the success of the production ML system?
  + Yes
  >  Exactly! It consists of the incredibly important steps to the production ML system success.
4. What do you apply to maximize predictive signals in your data?
  + Feature engineering
  > You’ve figured it out! Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features with high levels of predictive signal from raw data.
5. Your training data should reflect the diversity and cultural context of the people who will use it. What can be done to mitigate inherent biases in a given data set?
  + Collect data from equal proportions from different user groups.
  > Excellent! Balanced sampling from different user groups helps avoid inherent biases.
6. Question 6
More often than not,  ML systems can fail the users it serves. In this context, what is representational harm?
  + The amplification or negative reflection of certain groups stereotypes.
  > This is a prototypical way an ML system may fail the users it serves.
7. Accurate labels are necessary to properly train supervised models. Many times, human subjects known as raters perform this labeling effort. What are the main categories of human raters? (check all that apply). 
  + Generalists
  > Generalists usually come from crowdsourcing sites.
  + Subject matter experts
  > A classical example is radiologists labeling medical images for automated diagnosis tools.
  + Your users
  > Users can provide labels within your application. A classical example is photo tagging
